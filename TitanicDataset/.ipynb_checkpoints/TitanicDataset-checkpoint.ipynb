    "# Titanic Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this second dataset, I will focus on learning the methodology and workflow practices for working through a data science problem using the tutorial from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/renil93/titanic/titanic-data-science-solutions/notebook) to better learn these processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "While I may be using the tutorial, I will also be researching and using other/additional methods then what is provided with the tutorial to further explore machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow stages\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle competition solutions follow a workflow of seven stages:\n",
    "1. Question or problem definition.\n",
    "2. Aquire training and testing data.\n",
    "3. Wrangle, prepare, and cleanse the data.\n",
    "4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\n",
    "5. Model, predict, and solve the problem.\n",
    "6. Vizualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\n",
    "7. Supply or submit the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question and problem definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this problem was defined by Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), I will go ahead and paste the problem definition here:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So before moving on, one thing the tutorial suggests is to *develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem*. This will be done by looking at some of the highlights from the kaggle competition description [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic):\n",
    "\n",
    "* On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions workflow for data science solves for seven major goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "The below quotes are straight out of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Classifying**:\n",
    ">We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correlating**:\n",
    ">One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset.\n",
    ">* Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? \n",
    ">* Statistically speaking is there a correlation among a feature and solution goal?\n",
    ">* As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa?\n",
    ">This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Converting**:\n",
    ">For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Completing**:\n",
    ">Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correcting**:\n",
    ">We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Creating**:\n",
    ">Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Charting**:\n",
    ">How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals. See [this](https://www.tableau.com/learn/whitepapers/which-chart-or-graph-is-right-for-you#ERAcoH5sEG5CFlek.99) for more info. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best practices \n",
    "* Performing feature correlation analysis early in the project.\n",
    "* Using multiple plots instad of overlays for readability.\n"
